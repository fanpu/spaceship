# Spaceship
This game is a proof of concept that even in traditional stateful 
paradigms such as games, it is possible to take advantage of Rx's 
powerful methods to compose and transform Observables to achieve a 
stateless program while retaining processing and memory efficiency. 

# Controls
Mouse to move horizontally, click to shoot. Game ends when you get hit 
either by the enemy or their projectiles.

# Hosted
